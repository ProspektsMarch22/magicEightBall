# Magic Eight Ball

A study in control-flow in basic Javascript.

Use the variables "userName" and "userQuestion" to ask questions to the magic eight ball!

If you leave these variables empty, i prepared some exceptions so the code doesn't jam. 

My personal challenge was to not implement a "if" statement whatsoever. So instead of verifying information using a conditional statement, i implemented a short-circuit evaluation, and for the random results i use a switch statement.

In the original project, Codecademy suggests that i reserve the value of the MEB predictions on a variable. I preferred just to console.log it right off the switch statement, so i have the cleanest code possible.
